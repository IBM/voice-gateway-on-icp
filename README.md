# Automating Call Centers with Voice Gateway on IBM Cloud Private

This code pattern is a Voice Gateway application that enables companies to automate their call centers using Watson Assistant, Text to Speech, and Speech to Text, without having to orchestrate between all the different services yourself; the Voice Gateway will do that for you.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Deploy the Voice Gateway on an IBM Cloud Private Instance
* Connect the Voice Gateway to Twilio via the SIP communication protocol
* Use a Service Orchestration Engine with the Voice Gateway

## Flow

1. Setup the Watson Assistant, Text to Speech, and Speech to Text services on the public cloud.
2. Import the conversation flow, intents, and entities, into the Assistant service.
3. Deploy the Voice Gateway on IBM Cloud Private.
4. Setup Voice Gateway with Twilio.
5. Setup the Service Orchestration Engine (SOE).
6. Connect the Voice Gateway with the SOE.
5. Call the Twilio phone number
