# Automating Call Centers with Voice Gateway on IBM Cloud Private

This code pattern is a Voice Gateway application that enables companies to automate their call centers using Watson Assistant, Text to Speech, and Speech to Text, without having to orchestrate between all the different services yourself; the Voice Gateway will do that for you.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Deploy the Voice Gateway on an IBM Cloud Private Instance
* Connect the Voice Gateway to Twilio via the SIP communication protocol
* Use a Service Orchestration Engine with the Voice Gateway

## Flow

1. Setup the Watson Assistant, Text to Speech, and Speech to Text services on the public cloud.
2. Import the conversation flow, intents, and entities, into the Assistant service.
3. Deploy the Voice Gateway on IBM Cloud Private.
4. Setup Voice Gateway with Twilio.
5. Setup the Service Orchestration Engine (SOE).
6. Connect the Voice Gateway with the SOE.
5. Call the Twilio phone number

## Prerequisites

## Steps

### Setup IBM Cloud Private

In order to setup and install IBM Cloud Private Community Edition, please follow [these steps](https://github.com/IBM/deploy-ibm-cloud-private).

### Create the Assistant, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech services on IBM Cloud

Start by heading over to your IBM Cloud catalog and creating 3 services:

1. Watson Assistant
1. Watson Speech to Text
1. Watson Text to Speech

### Setup your Assistant

Now, setup your chatbot - you can either create your own chatbot, use the example workspace provided in this code pattern, or use a conversation from another code pattern (e.g. TODO: Add other code pattern examples).

If you'd like to use the workspace provided in this pattern, then import the [workspace.json]("data/workspace.json") file provided in the repo into your Assistant tooling.

### Deploy the Voice Gateway on IBM Cloud Private

The interface of IBM Cloud Private is, of course, very similar to that of IBM Cloud (public); so you should find it easy to navigate this interface if you're familiar with IBM Cloud.

Head over to the Catalog, and either search for, or scroll down to, the `ibm-voice-gateway-dev` tile. Click on the tile, and then click "Configure".

You can then enter a "Release name" (the name of your service), a "Target namespace" (where to store this service), and then read the license agreements. If you agree, check the checkbox.

Finally, you can ignore all of the fields in the following form except for the Watson API Credential fields - go ahead and fill them all out (Assistant, STT, TTS). Once you fill out these fields, you can click on the "Install" button.

### Connect Voice Gateway with Twilio through SIP

TODO: Steve, please fill this out as you're the expert at navigating the "documentation" for ICP.
